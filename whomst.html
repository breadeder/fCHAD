	<h2>BLACKPAPER</h2>
	<h4>The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of Chads and Virgins. 
	For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; 
	by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.</h4>
	<h5>IMMANUEL KANT </h5>

	<h3>Accumulation is the name of the game. To become Chad you must act like Chad, and to act like Chad you must think like Chad.
		To think like Chad, you must understand how fCHAD operates. For this, we present the first BLACKPAPER. Why? Chad does 
		as he sees fit.<br><br>
		
		fCHAD is a deflationary token on the Opera network. It has an initial supply of 69 million. Every transaction is watched by the all-seeing eye of Chad. Selling
		or transferring FCHAD tokens is a cringe move, so Chad will personally burn a percentage of your tokens according to the current price when you moved them.
		The number of tokens Chad burns is calculated on a curve scale (Chad does the math instantly in his head, he does not make errors). The lower the price when you sell or transfer
		your fCHAD, the more tokens are burnt.<br><br>
		<img src="graph.png" class="graph">
		<br>
		51% of the burnt fCHAD tokens will be sent to the burn address and never seen again. 49% are held in a reserve account to be despersed to true Chad traders at a future date.
		Chad will reveal the details of this soon. Every transfer and sell of fCHAD, the circulating supply drops. Buying fCHAD tokens incurs no burn. Slurping is a Chad move.
